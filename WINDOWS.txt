Scheme 48 Windows port
----------------------
Copyright (c) 1993-2005 by Richard Kelsey and Jonathan Rees. See file COPYING.

Starting with version 1.3, Scheme 48 has a native Windows port, which
works on Windows NT 4.0 and above (including Windows 2000 and XP, but
not Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows ME).  At this time, the port is
considered experimental.

Specifically, the following caveats apply to the Windows port:

o I/O is always binary; the I/O system doesn't perform any kind of
  automatic CR/LF conversion.
o UDP sockets don't work.  (But TCP sockets do.)
o The "old-style" interface to loading external code dynamically
  doesn't work.  (But the new interface works---see doc\news.txt and
  the documentation.)
o The Posix libraries don't work (and probably never will, at least
  not in the current form).

Installing Scheme 48 from the installer
---------------------------------------

To install Scheme 48, download the .msi file and double-click on it.
This requires Windows Installer version 2.0 or greater to work.

Building Scheme 48 from source
------------------------------

The Scheme 48 developers build the VM using Microsoft Visual C++
6.0SP6.  To build the VM, load the scheme48.dsw workspace file into
Visual C++, choose a configuration ("Win32 Debug" or "Win32 Release")
and build.  You'll need to have run build\generate-c-header.bat
previously---see below.  To generate the standard Scheme 48 image,
you'll need to run build\build-usual-image.bat---also described below.

You can then start Scheme 48 by saying

scheme48vm -i scheme48.image

(The installer creates a suitable front-end batch file for this
incantation.)

A number of batch files are supposed to do the jobs of the various
other make targets in the Unix Makefile.  To run them, you should be
sitting in a shell in the root of the Scheme 48 hierarchy.  Note that,
for all except build-usual-image.bat you'll need to have a working
Scheme 48 available your machine:

build\generate-c-header.bat
  This generates the c\scheme48.h header file needed for compiling
  various VM extensions.

  It requires a command-line argument specifying how to start up a
  Scheme 48 REPL.

  Example:

  build\generate-c-header.bat "C:\Program Files\Scheme 48\Scheme 48 1.3\scheme48"

build\build-usual-image.bat
  This generates the default scheme48.image from build\initial.image.

  It requires five command-line arguments:

  - the root directory of the Scheme 48 sources
    *with a trailing backslash*
  - the full path of the installed scheme/ subdirectory of the Scheme
    48 sources
  - the name of the image file to be generated
  - the name of the VM executable
  - the filename of the initial image

  Example (supposing the Scheme 48 root directory sits at c:\scheme48)

  build\build-usual-image ".\" "C:\Program Files\Scheme 48\Scheme 48 1.3\scheme" scheme48vm.exe sche build\initial.image

build\build-initial-image.bat
  This builds build\initial.image from source.

  It requires a command-line argument specifying how to start up a
  Scheme 48 REPL.

  Before running it, you need to generate build\filenames.bat via

  <Scheme 48> -a batch < build\filenames.scm
  where <Scheme 48> starts up a Scheme 48 REPL, for example
  "C:\Program Files\Scheme 48\Scheme 48 1.3\scheme48" -a batch < build\filenames.scm

  build\build-initial-image.bat "C:\Program Files\Scheme 48\Scheme 48 1.3\scheme48"

build\i-know-what-i-am-doing.bat
  This builds the VM C sources from Scheme.

  It requires a command-line argument specifying how to start up a
  Scheme 48 REPL.

  build\i-know-what-i-am-doing.bat "C:\Program Files\Scheme 48\Scheme 48 1.3\scheme48"
