Scheme 48 installation instructions for Unix
--------------------------------------------

(for notes on Windows installation, check WINDOWS.txt)

A typical installation would proceed as follows: download the .tgz
file to your /tmp directory, and then issue the following shell
commands:

  cd /usr/local/src
  gunzip </tmp/scheme48-1.7.tgz | tar xf -
  cd scheme48-1.7
  ./configure
  make install

Then simply do

  scheme48

to run it.

This assumes that the logged-in user has write access to the
/usr/local directory tree, and that /usr/local/bin is in the Scheme 48
user's PATH.  If not, replace "cd /usr/local/src" with "cd DIR" where
DIR is the directory into which to extract the scheme48 source tree,
issue the command "make" instead of "make install" to build it, and

  ./go

to run it.

Attached to this file is generic information about the 'configure'
script.  The 'configure' script that ships with Scheme 48 has some
specific options, however:

--enable-gc=<gc>

configures Scheme 48 with a specific garbage collector (GC).  Two GCs
ship with the system "twospace" and "bibop": The twospace GC is the
default---it is simple, but has inferior performance and requires a
fixed limit on the heap size.  The bibop GC is much more sophisticated
and faster, and it allows specifying "-h 0" on the command line,
meaning that the heap will expand as necessary to accomodate the
program.  Note that this means that a program with, say, infinite
non-tail recursion will grow the heap indefinitely.

--enable-universal-binary

works only on Apple Macs and means that Scheme 48 will be built as a
Universal Binary that can run on both PowerPC and Intel Macs.

see doc/install.txt.

----------------

   This is a generic INSTALL file for utilities distributions.
If this package does not come with, e.g., installable documentation or
data files, please ignore the references to them below.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation, and
creates the Makefile(s) (one in each subdirectory of the source
directory).  In some packages it creates a C header file containing
system-dependent definitions.  It also creates a file `config.status'
that you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration.

To compile this package:

1.  Configure the package for your system.

   Normally, you just `cd' to the directory containing the package's
source code and type `./configure'.  If you're using `csh' on an old
version of System V, you might need to type `sh configure' instead to
prevent `csh' from trying to execute `configure' itself.

   Running `configure' takes a minute or two.  While it is running, it
prints some messages that tell what it is doing.  If you don't want to
see the messages, run `configure' with its standard output redirected
to `/dev/null'; for example, `./configure >/dev/null'.

   To compile the package in a different directory from the one
containing the source code, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.  If
for some reason `configure' is not in the source code directory that
you are configuring, then it will report that it can't find the source
code.  In that case, run `configure' with the option `--srcdir=DIR',
where DIR is the directory that contains the source code.

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.  Alternately, you can do so by consistently
giving a value for the `prefix' variable when you run `make', e.g.,
     make prefix=/usr/gnu
     make prefix=/usr/gnu install

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH' or set the `make'
variable `exec_prefix' to PATH, the package will use PATH as the prefix
for installing programs and libraries.  Data files and documentation
will still use the regular prefix.  Normally, all files are installed
using the same prefix.

   Some packages pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options to
`configure', where PACKAGE is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X
Window System).  The README should mention any `--with-' options that
the package recognizes.

   `configure' ignores any other arguments that you give it.

   On systems that require unusual options for compilation or linking
that the package's `configure' script does not know about, you can give
`configure' initial values for variables by setting them in the
environment.  In Bourne-compatible shells, you can do that on the
command line like this:

     CC='gcc -traditional' LIBS=-lposix ./configure

   Here are the `make' variables that you might want to override with
environment variables when running `configure'.

   For these variables, any value given in the environment overrides the
value that `configure' would choose:

 - Variable: CC
     C compiler program.  The default is `cc'.

 - Variable: INSTALL
     Program to use to install files.  The default is `install' if you
     have it, `cp' otherwise.

   For these variables, any value given in the environment is added to
the value that `configure' chooses:

 - Variable: DEFS
     Configuration options, in the form `-Dfoo -Dbar...'.  Do not use
     this variable in packages that create a configuration header file.

 - Variable: LIBS
     Libraries to link with, in the form `-lfoo -lbar...'.

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, we encourage
you to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and
mail diffs or instructions to the address given in the README so we
can include them in the next release.

2.  Type `make' to compile the package.  If you want, you can override
the `make' variables CFLAGS and LDFLAGS like this:

	make CFLAGS=-O2 LDFLAGS=-s

3.  If the package comes with self-tests and you want to run them,
type `make check'.  If you're not sure whether there are any, try it;
if `make' responds with something like
	make: *** No way to make target `check'.  Stop.
then the package does not come with self-tests.

4.  Type `make install' to install programs, data files, and
documentation.

5.  You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
source directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
Makefile(s), the header file containing system-dependent definitions
(if the package uses one), and `config.status' (all the files that
`configure' created), type `make distclean'.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need it if you want to regenerate
`configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.
