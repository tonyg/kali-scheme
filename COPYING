Distributing Autoconf Output
****************************

   The configuration scripts that Autoconf produces are covered by the
GNU General Public License.  This is because they consist almost
entirely of parts of Autoconf itself, rearranged somewhat, and Autoconf
is distributed under the terms of the GPL.  As applied to Autoconf, the
GPL just means that you need to distribute `configure.in' along with
`configure'.

   Programs that use Autoconf scripts to configure themselves do not
automatically come under the GPL.  Distributing an Autoconf
configuration script as part of a program is considered to be *mere
aggregation* of that work with the Autoconf script.  Such programs are
not derivative works based on Autoconf; only their configuration scripts
are.  We still encourage software authors to distribute their work under
terms like those of the GPL, but doing so is not required to use
Autoconf.
