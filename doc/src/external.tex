\chapter{Mixing Scheme 48 and C}
\label{external-chapter}

This chapter describes an interface for calling C functions
 from Scheme, calling Scheme functions from C, and allocating
 storage in the Scheme heap..
Scheme~48 manages stub functions in C that
 negotiate between the calling conventions of Scheme and C and the
 memory allocation policies of both worlds.
No stub generator is available yet, but writing stubs is a straightforward task.

\section{Available facilities}
\label{sec:facilities}

The following facilities are available for interfacing between
 Scheme~48 and C:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Scheme code can call C functions.
\item The external interface provides full introspection for all
  Scheme objects.  External code may inspect, modify, and allocate
  Scheme objects arbitrarily.
\item External code may raise exceptions back to Scheme~48 to
  signal errors.
\item External code may call back into Scheme.  Scheme~48
  correctly unrolls the process stack on non-local exits.
\item External modules may register bindings of names to values with a 
  central registry accessible from
  Scheme.  Conversely, Scheme code can register shared
  bindings for access by C code.
\end{itemize}
%
%This section has three parts: the first describes how bindings are
% moved from Scheme to C and vice versa, the second tells how to call
% C functions from Scheme, and the third covers the C interface
% to Scheme objects, including calling Scheme procedures, using the
% Scheme heap, and so forth.

\subsection{Scheme structures}

The structure \code{external-calls} has 
 most of the Scheme functions described here.
The others are in 
 \code{dynamic-externals}, which has the functions for dynamic loading and
 name lookup from
\texonly{Section~\ref{dynamic-externals},}
\htmlonly{the section on \link{Dynamic Loading}{dynamic-externals},}
 and \code{shared-bindings}, which has the additional shared-binding functions
 described in
\texonly{Section~\ref{more-shared-bindings}.}
\htmlonly{the section on the \link{complete shared-binding interface}{more-shared-bindings}.}

\subsection{C naming conventions}

The names of all of Scheme~48's visible C bindings begin 
 with `\code{s48\_}' (for procedures and variables) or 
 `\code{S48\_}' (for macros).
Whenever a C name is derived from a Scheme identifier, we
 replace `\code{-}' with `\code{\_}' and convert letters to lowercase
 for procedures and uppercase for macros.
A final `\code{?}'  converted to `\code{\_p}' (`\code{\_P}' in C macro names).
A final `\code{!}' is dropped.
Thus the C macro for Scheme's \code{pair?} is \code{S48\_PAIR\_P} and
 the one for \code{set-car!} is \code{S48\_SET\_CAR}.
Procedures and macros that do not check the types of their arguments
 have `\code{unsafe}' in their names.

All of the C functions and macros described have prototypes or definitions
 in the file \code{c/scheme48.h}.
The C type for Scheme values is defined there to be \code{s48\_value}.

\subsection{Garbage collection}

Scheme~48 uses a copying garbage collector.
The collector must be able to locate all references
 to objects allocated in the Scheme~48 heap in order to ensure that
 storage is not reclaimed prematurely and to update references to objects
 moved by the collector.
The garbage collector may run whenever an object is allocated in the heap.
C variables whose values are Scheme~48 objects and which are live across
 heap allocation calls need to be registered with
 the
\link{garbage collector}
[garbage collector.  See section~\Ref{} for more information]{gc}.

\section{Shared bindings}
\label{sec:shared-bindings}

Shared bindings are the means by which named values are shared between Scheme
 code and C code.
There are two separate tables of shared bindings, one for values defined in
 Scheme and accessed from C and the other for values going the other way.
Shared bindings actually bind names to cells, to allow a name to be looked
 up before it has been assigned.
This is necessary because C initialization code may be run before or after
 the corresponding Scheme code, depending on whether the Scheme code is in
 the resumed image or is run in the current session.

\subsection{Exporting Scheme values to C}

\begin{protos}
\proto{define-exported-binding}{ name value}{shared-binding}
\end{protos}

\begin{protos}
\cproto{s48\_value s48\_get\_imported\_binding(char *name)}
\cproto{s48\_value S48\_SHARED\_BINDING\_REF(s48\_value shared\_binding)}
\end{protos}

\noindent\code{Define-exported-binding} makes \cvar{value} available to C code
 under as \cvar{name} which must be a \cvar{string}, creating a new shared
 binding if necessary.
The C function \code{s48\_get\_imported\_binding} returns the shared binding
 defined for \code{name}, again creating it if necessary.
The C macro \code{S48\_SHARED\_BINDING\_REF} dereferences a shared binding,
 returning its current value.

\subsection{Exporting C values to Scheme}

\begin{protos}
\cproto{void s48\_define\_exported\_binding(char *name, s48\_value v)}
\end{protos}

\begin{protos}
\proto{lookup-imported-binding}{ string}{shared-binding}
\proto{shared-binding-ref}{ shared-binding}{value}
\end{protos}

\noindent These are used to define shared bindings from C and to access them
 from Scheme.
Again, if a name is looked up before it has been defined, a new binding is
 created for it.

The common case of exporting a C function to Scheme can be done using
 the macro \code{S48\_EXPORT\_FUNCTION(\cvar{name})}.
This expands into
\begin{example}
s48\_define\_exported\_binding("\cvar{name}",
                               s48\_enter\_pointer(\cvar{name}))
\end{example}

\noindent which boxes the function into a Scheme byte vector and then
 exports it.
Note that \code{s48\_enter\_pointer} allocates space in the Scheme heap
 and might trigger a 
 \link{garbage collection}[; see Section~\ref{gc}]{gc}.

\begin{protos}
\syntaxprotonoresult{import-definition}{ \cvar{name}}
\syntaxprotonoresultnoindex{import-definition}{ \cvar{name c-name}}
\end{protos}
These macros simplify importing definitions from C to Scheme.
They expand into

\code{(define \cvar{name} (lookup-imported-binding \cvar{c-name}))}

\noindent{}where \cvar{c-name} is as supplied for the second form.
For the first form \cvar{c-name} is derived from \cvar{name} by
 replacing `\code{-}' with `\code{\_}' and converting letters to lowercase.
For example, \code{(import-definition my-foo)} expands into

\code{(define my-foo (lookup-imported-binding "my\_foo"))}

\subsection{Complete shared binding interface}
\label{more-shared-bindings}

There are a number of other Scheme functions related to shared bindings;
 these are in the structure \code{shared-bindings}.

\begin{protos}
\proto{shared-binding?}{ x}{boolean}
\proto{shared-binding-name}{ shared-binding}{string}
\proto{shared-binding-is-import?}{ shared-binding}{boolean}
\protonoresult{shared-binding-set!}{ shared-binding value}
\protonoresult{define-imported-binding}{ string value}
\protonoresult{lookup-exported-binding}{ string}
\protonoresult{undefine-imported-binding}{ string}{}
\protonoresult{undefine-exported-binding}{ string}{}
\end{protos}

\noindent\code{Shared-binding?} is the predicate for shared-bindings.
\code{Shared-binding-name} returns the name of a binding.
\code{Shared-binding-is-import?} is true if the binding was defined from C.
\code{Shared-binding-set!} changes the value of a binding.
\code{Define-imported-binding} and \code{lookup-exported-binding} are
 Scheme versions of \code{s48\_define\_exported\_binding}
 and \code{s48\_lookup\_imported\_binding}.
The two \code{undefine-} procedures remove bindings from the two tables.
They do nothing if the name is not found in the table.

The following C macros correspond to the Scheme functions above.

\begin{protos}
\cproto{int\ \ \ \ \ \ \ S48\_SHARED\_BINDING\_P(x)}
\cproto{int\ \ \ \ \ \ \ S48\_SHARED\_BINDING\_IS\_IMPORT\_P(s48\_value s\_b)}
\cproto{s48\_value S48\_SHARED\_BINDING\_NAME(s48\_value s\_b)}
\cproto{void\ \ \ \ \ \ S48\_SHARED\_BINDING\_SET(s48\_value s\_b, s48\_value v)}
\end{protos}

\section{Calling C functions from Scheme}
\label{sec:external-call}

There are three different ways to call C functions from Scheme, depending on
 how the C function was obtained.

\begin{protos}
\proto{call-imported-binding}{ binding arg$_0$ \ldots}{value}
\proto{call-external}{ external arg$_0$ \ldots}{value}
\proto{call-external-value}{ value name arg$_0$ \ldots}{value}
\end{protos}
\noindent
Each of these applies its first argument, a C function, to the rest of
 the arguments.
For \code{call-imported-binding} the function argument must be an
 imported binding.
For \code{call-external} the function argument must be an external
 bound in the current process
 (see
\texonly{Section~\ref{dynamic-externals}).}
\htmlonly{the section on \link{Dynamic Loading}{dynamic-externals}).}
For \code{call-external-value} \cvar{value} must be a byte vector
 whose contents is a pointer to a C function and \cvar{name} should be
 a string naming the function.
The \cvar{name} argument is used only for printing error messages.

For all of these, the C function is passed the \cvar{arg$_i$} values
 and the value returned is that returned by C procedure.
No automatic representation conversion occurs for either arguments or
 return values.
Up to twelve arguments may be passed.
There is no method supplied for returning multiple values to
 Scheme from C (or vice versa) (mainly because C does not have multiple return
 values).

Keyboard interrupts that occur during a call to a C function are ignored
 until the function returns to Scheme (this is clearly a
 problem; we are working on a solution).

\begin{protos}
\syntaxprotonoresult{import-lambda-definition}
{ \cvar{name} (\cvar{formal} \ldots)}
\syntaxprotonoresultnoindex{import-lambda-definition}
{ \cvar{name} (\cvar{formal} \ldots)\ \cvar{c-name}}
\end{protos}
\noindent{}These macros simplify importing functions from C.
They define \cvar{name} to be a function with the given formals that
 applies those formals to the corresponding C binding.
\cvar{C-name}, if supplied, should be a string.
These expand into

\begin{example}
(define temp (lookup-imported-binding \cvar{c-name}))
(define \cvar{name}
  (lambda (\cvar{formal} \ldots)
    (external-apply temp \cvar{formal} \ldots)))
\end{example}

\noindent{}
If \cvar{c-name} is not supplied, it is derived from \cvar{name} by converting
 all letters to lowercase and replacing `\code{-}' with `\code{\_}'.

\section{Adding external modules to the {\tt Makefile}}
\label{sec:external-modules}

Getting access to C bindings from Scheme requires that the C code be
 compiled and linked in with the Scheme~48 virtual machine and that the
 relevant shared bindings be created.
The Scheme~48 makefile has rules for compiling and linking external code
 and for specifying initialization functions that should be called on
 startup.
There are three \code{Makefile} variables that control which external modules are
 included in the executable for the virtual machine (\code{scheme48vm}).
\code{EXTERNAL\_OBJECTS} lists the object files to be included in
 \code{scheme48vm},
\code{EXTERNAL\_FLAGS} is a list of \code{ld} flags to be used when
 creating \code{scheme48vm}, and
 \code{EXTERNAL\_INITIALIZERS} is a list of C procedures to be called
 on startup.
The procedures listed in \code{EXTERNAL\_INITIALIZERS} should take no
 arguments and have a return type of \code{void}.
After changing the definitions of any of these variables you should
 do \code{make scheme48vm} to rebuild the virtual machine.

\section{Dynamic loading}
\label{dynamic-externals}

External code can be loaded into a running Scheme~48 process
 and C object-file bindings can be dereferenced at runtime and
 their values called
 (although not all versions of Unix support all of this).
The required Scheme functions are in the structure \code{dynamic-externals}.

\begin{protos}
\protonoresult{dynamic-load}{ string}{}
\end{protos}
\noindent
\code{Dynamic-load} loads the named file into the current
 process, raising an exception if the file cannot be found or if dynamic
 loading is not supported by the operating system.
The file must have been compiled and linked appropriately.
For Linux, the following commands compile \code{foo.c} into a
 file \code{foo.so} that can be loaded dynamically.
\begin{example}
\% gcc -c -o foo.o foo.c
\% ld -shared -o foo.so foo.o
\end{example}

\begin{protos}
\proto{get-external}{ string}{external}
\proto{external?}{ x}{boolean}
\proto{external-name}{ external}{string}
\proto{external-value}{ external}{byte-vector}
\end{protos}
\noindent
These functions give access to values bound in the current process, and
 are used for retrieving values from dynamically-loaded files.
\code{Get-external} returns an \var{external} object that contains the
 value of \cvar{name}, raising an exception if there is no such
 value in the current process.
\code{External?} is the predicate for externals, and
\code{external-name} and \code{external-value} return the name and
 value of an external.
The value is returned as byte vector of length four (on 32-bit
 architectures).
The value is that which was extant when \code{get-external} was
 called.
The following two functions can be used to update the values of
 externals.

\begin{protos}
\proto{lookup-external}{ external}{boolean}
\proto{lookup-all-externals}{}{boolean}
\end{protos}
\noindent
\code{Lookup-external} updates the value of \cvar{external} by looking up its
 name in the current process, returning \code{\#t} if the name is bound
 and \code{\#f} if it is not.
\code{Lookup-all-externals} calls \code{lookup-external} on all extant
 externals, returning \code{\#f} any are unbound.

\begin{protos}
\proto{call-external}{ external arg$_0$ \ldots}{value}
\end{protos}
\noindent
An external whose value is a C procedure can be called using
 \code{call-external}.
See
\texonly{Section~\ref{sec:external-call}}
\htmlonly{the section on \link{calling C functions from Scheme}{sec:external-call}}
for more information.

In some versions of Unix retrieving a value from the current
 process may require a non-trivial amount of computation.
We recommend that a dynamically-loaded file contain a single initialization
 procedure that creates shared bindings for the values exported by the file.

\section{Compatibility}

% JAR says: give version number (I would if I knew what it was -RK)
Scheme~48's old \code{external-call} function is still available in the
 structure
 \code{externals}, which now also includes \code{external-name} and
 \code{external-value}.
The old \code{scheme48.h} file has been renamed \code{old-scheme48.h}.

\section{Accessing Scheme data from C}
\label{sec:scheme-data}

The C header file \code{scheme48.h} provides
 access to Scheme~48 data structures.
The type \code{s48\_value} is used for Scheme values.
When the type of a value is known, such as the integer returned
 by \code{vector-length} or the boolean returned by \code{pair?},
 the corresponding C procedure returns a C value of the appropriate
 type, and not a \code{s48\_value}.
Predicates return \code{1} for true and \code{0} for false.

\subsection{Constants}
\label{sec:constants}

The following macros denote Scheme constants:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{S48\_FALSE} is \verb|#f|.
\item \code{S48\_TRUE} is \verb|#t|.
\item \code{S48\_NULL} is the empty list.
\item \code{S48\_UNSPECIFIC} is a value used for functions which have no
  meaningful return value
 (in Scheme~48 this value returned by the nullary procedure \code{unspecific}
 in the structure \code{util}).
\item \code{S48\_EOF} is the end-of-file object
 (in Scheme~48 this value is returned by the nullary procedure \code{eof-object}
 in the structure \code{i/o-internal}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Converting values}

The following macros and functions convert values between Scheme and C
 representations.
The `extract' ones convert from Scheme to C and the `enter's go the other
 way.

\begin{protos}
\cproto{int \ \ \ \ \ \ S48\_EXTRACT\_BOOLEAN(s48\_value)}
\cproto{unsigned char s48\_extract\_char(s48\_value)}
\cproto{char * \ \ \ s48\_extract\_string(s48\_value)}
\cproto{char * \ \ \ s48\_extract\_byte\_vector(s48\_value)}
\cproto{long \ \ \ \ \ s48\_extract\_integer(s48\_value)}
\cproto{double \ \ \ s48\_extract\_double(s48\_value)}
\cproto{s48\_value S48\_ENTER\_BOOLEAN(int)}
\cproto{s48\_value s48\_enter\_char(unsigned char)}
\cgcproto{s48\_value s48\_enter\_string(char *)}
\cgcproto{s48\_value s48\_enter\_byte\_vector(char *, long)}
\cgcproto{s48\_value s48\_enter\_integer(long)}
\cgcproto{s48\_value s48\_enter\_double(double)}
\end{protos}

\noindent{}\code{S48\_EXTRACT\_BOOLEAN} is false if its argument is
 \code{\#f} and true otherwise.
 \code{S48\_ENTER\_BOOLEAN} is \code{\#f} if its argument is zero
  and \code{\#t} otherwise.

 \code{s48\_extract\_string} and \code{s48\_extract\_byte\_vector} return
 pointers to the actual
 storage used by the string or byte vector.
 These pointers are valid only until the next
 \link{garbage collection}[; see Section~\ref{gc}]{gc}.

The second argument to \code{s48\_enter\_byte\_vector} is the length of
 byte vector.

\code{s48\_enter\_integer()} needs to allocate storage when
 its argument is too large to fit in a Scheme~48 fixnum.
In cases where the number is known to fit within a fixnum (currently 30 bits
 including the sign), the following procedures can be used.
These have the disadvantage of only having a limited range, but
 the advantage of never causing a garbage collection.
\code{S48\_FIXNUM\_P} is a macro that true if its argument is a fixnum
 and false otherwise.

\begin{protos}
\cproto{int \ \ \ \ \ \ S48\_TRUE\_P(s48\_value)}
\cproto{int \ \ \ \ \ \ S48\_FALSE\_P(s48\_value)}
\end{protos}

\noindent \code{S48\_TRUE\_P} is true if its argument is \code{S48\_TRUE}
 and \code{S48\_FALSE\_P} is true if its argument is \code{S48\_FALSE}.

\begin{protos}
\cproto{int \ \ \ \ \ \ S48\_FIXNUM\_P(s48\_value)}
\cproto{long \ \ \ \ \ s48\_extract\_fixnum(s48\_value)}
\cproto{s48\_value s48\_enter\_fixnum(long)}
\cproto{long \ \ \ \ \ S48\_MAX\_FIXNUM\_VALUE}
\cproto{long \ \ \ \ \ S48\_MIN\_FIXNUM\_VALUE}
\end{protos}

\noindent An error is signalled if \code{s48\_extract\_fixnum}'s argument
 is not a fixnum or if the argument to \code{s48\_enter\_fixnum} is less than
 \code{S48\_MIN\_FIXNUM\_VALUE} or greater than \code{S48\_MAX\_FIXNUM\_VALUE}
 ($-2^{29}$ and $2^{29}-1$ in the current system).

\subsection{C versions of Scheme procedures}

The following macros and procedures are C versions of Scheme procedures.
The names were derived by replacing `\code{-}' with `\code{\_}',
 `\code{?}' with `\code{\_P}', and dropping `\code{!}.

\begin{protos}
\cproto{int \ \ \ \ \ \ S48\_EQ\_P(s48\_value, s48\_VALUE)}
\cproto{int \ \ \ \ \ \ S48\_CHAR\_P(s48\_value)}
\end{protos}
\begin{protos}
\cproto{int \ \ \ \ \ \ S48\_PAIR\_P(s48\_value)}
\cproto{s48\_value S48\_CAR(s48\_value)}
\cproto{s48\_value S48\_CDR(s48\_value)}
\cproto{void \ \ \ \ \ S48\_SET\_CAR(s48\_value, s48\_value)}
\cproto{void \ \ \ \ \ S48\_SET\_CDR(s48\_value, s48\_value)}
\cgcproto{s48\_value s48\_cons(s48\_value, s48\_value)}
\cproto{long \ \ \ \ \ s48\_length(s48\_value)} 
\end{protos}
\begin{protos}
\cproto{int \ \ \ \ \ \ S48\_VECTOR\_P(s48\_value)} 
\cproto{long \ \ \ \ \ S48\_VECTOR\_LENGTH(s48\_value)} 
\cproto{s48\_value S48\_VECTOR\_REF(s48\_value, long)} 
\cproto{void \ \ \ \ \ S48\_VECTOR\_SET(s48\_value, long, s48\_value)} 
\cgcproto{s48\_value s48\_make\_vector(long, s48\_value)}
\end{protos}
\begin{protos}
\cproto{int \ \ \ \ \ \ S48\_STRING\_P(s48\_value)} 
\cproto{long \ \ \ \ \ S48\_STRING\_LENGTH(s48\_value)} 
\cproto{char \ \ \ \ \ S48\_STRING\_REF(s48\_value, long)} 
\cproto{void \ \ \ \ \ S48\_STRING\_SET(s48\_value, long, char)} 
\cgcproto{s48\_value s48\_make\_string(long, char)}
\end{protos}
\begin{protos}
\cproto{int \ \ \ \ \ \ S48\_SYMBOL\_P(s48\_value)} 
\cproto{s48\_value s48\_SYMBOL\_TO\_STRING(s48\_value)} 
\end{protos}
\begin{protos}
\cproto{int \ \ \ \ \ \ S48\_BYTE\_VECTOR\_P(s48\_value)} 
\cproto{long \ \ \ \ \ S48\_BYTE\_VECTOR\_LENGTH(s48\_value)} 
\cproto{char \ \ \ \ \ S48\_BYTE\_VECTOR\_REF(s48\_value, long)} 
\cproto{void \ \ \ \ \ S48\_BYTE\_VECTOR\_SET(s48\_value, long, int)} 
\cgcproto{s48\_value s48\_make\_byte\_vector(long, int)}
\end{protos}

\section{Calling Scheme functions from C}
\label{sec:external-callback}

External code that has been called from Scheme can call back to Scheme
 procedures using the following function.

\begin{protos}
\cproto{s48\_value s48\_call\_scheme(s48\_value p, long nargs, \ldots)}
\end{protos}
\noindent{}This calls the Scheme procedure \code{p} on \code{nargs}
 arguments, which are passed as additional arguments to \code{s48\_call\_scheme}.
There may be at most twelve arguments.
The value returned by the Scheme procedure is returned by the C procedure.
Invoking any Scheme procedure may potentially cause a garbage collection.

There are some complications that occur when mixing calls from C to Scheme
 with continuations and threads.
C only supports downward continuations (via \code{longjmp()}).
Scheme continuations that capture a portion of the C stack have to follow the
 same restriction.
For example, suppose Scheme procedure \code{s0} captures continuation \code{a}
 and then calls C procedure \code{c0}, which in turn calls Scheme procedure
 \code{s1}.
Procedure \code{s1} can safely call the continuation \code{a}, because that
 is a downward use.
When \code{a} is called Scheme~48 will remove the portion of the C stack used
 by the call to \code{c0}.
On the other hand, if \code{s1} captures a continuation, that continuation
 cannot be used from \code{s0}, because by the time control returns to
 \code{s0} the C stack used by \code{c0} will no longer be valid.
An attempt to invoke an upward continuation that is closed over a portion
 of the C stack will raise an exception.

In Scheme~48 threads are implemented using continuations, so the downward
 restriction applies to them as well.
An attempt to return from Scheme to C at a time when the appropriate
 C frame is not on top of the C stack will cause the current thread to
 block until the frame is available.
For example, suppose thread \code{t0} calls a C procedure which calls back
 to Scheme, at which point control switches to thread \code{t1}, which also
 calls C and then back to Scheme.
At this point both \code{t0} and \code{t1} have active calls to C on the
 C stack, with \code{t1}'s C frame above \code{t0}'s.
If thread \code{t0} attempts to return from Scheme to C it will block,
 as its frame is not accessible.
Once \code{t1} has returned to C and from there to Scheme, \code{t0} will
 be able to resume.
The return to Scheme is required because context switches can only occur while
 Scheme code is running.
\code{T0} will also be able to resume if \code{t1} uses a continuation to
 throw past its call to C.

\section{Interacting with the Scheme heap}
\label{sec:heap-allocation}
\label{gc}

Scheme~48 uses a copying, precise garbage collector.
Any procedure that allocates objects within the Scheme~48 heap may trigger
 a garbage collection.
Variables bound to values in the Scheme~48 heap need to be registered with
 the garbage collector so that the value will be retained and so that the
 variables will be updated if the garbage collector moves the object.
The garbage collector has no facility for updating pointers to the interiors
 of objects, so such pointers, for example the ones returned by
 \code{EXTRACT\_STRING}, will likely become invalid when a garbage collection
 occurs.

\subsection{Registering objects with the GC}
\label{sec:gc-register}

A set of macros are used to manage the registration of local variables with the
 garbage collector.

\begin{protos}
\cproto{S48\_DECLARE\_GC\_PROTECT($n$)}
\cproto{void S48\_GC\_PROTECT\_$n$(s48\_value$_1$, $\ldots$, s48\_value$_n$)}
\cproto{void S48\_GC\_UNPROTECT()}
\end{protos}

\code{S48\_DECLARE\_GC\_PROTECT($n$)}, where  $1\leq n\leq 9$, allocates
 storage for registering $n$ variables.
% JAR says: what is a block?  (How to describe it? -RK)
At most one use of \code{S48\_DECLARE\_GC\_PROTECT} may occur in a
 block.
\code{S48\_GC\_PROTECT\_$n$($v_1$, $\ldots$, $v_n$)} registers the
 $n$ variables (l-values) with the garbage collector.
It must be within scope of a \code{S48\_DECLARE\_GC\_PROTECT($n$)}
 and be before any code which can cause a GC.
\code{S48\_GC\_UNPROTECT} removes the block's protected variables from
 the garbage collector's list.
It must be called at the end of the block after 
  any code which may cause a garbage collection.
Omitting any of the three may cause serious and
 hard-to-debug problems.
Notably, the garbage collector may relocate an object and
 invalidate \code{s48\_value} variables which are not protected.

A \code{gc-protection-mismatch} exception is raised if, when a C
 procedure returns to Scheme, the calls
 to \code{S48\_GC\_PROTECT()} have not been matched by an equal number of
 calls to \code{S48\_GC\_UNPROTECT()}.

Global variables may also be registered with the garbage collector.

\begin{protos}
\cproto{void S48\_GC\_PROTECT\_GLOBAL(\cvar{value})}
\end{protos}

\noindent{}\code{S48\_GC\_PROTECT\_GLOBAL} permanently registers the
  variable \cvar{value} (an l-value) with the garbage collector.
There is no way to unregister the variable.

\subsection{Keeping C data structures in the Scheme heap}
\label{sec:external-data}

C data structures can be kept in the Scheme heap by embedding them
 inside byte vectors.
The following macros can be used to create and access embedded C objects.

\begin{protos}
\cgcproto{s48\_value S48\_MAKE\_VALUE(type)}
\cproto{type \ \ \ \ \ S48\_EXTRACT\_VALUE(s48\_value, type)}
\cproto{type * \ \ \ S48\_EXTRACT\_VALUE\_POINTER(s48\_value, type)}
\cproto{void \ \ \ \ \ S48\_SET\_VALUE(s48\_value, type, value)}
\end{protos}

\noindent{}
\code{S48\_MAKE\_VALUE} makes a byte vector large enough to hold an object
 whose type is \cvar{type}.
\code{S48\_EXTRACT\_VALUE} returns the contents of a byte vector cast to
 \cvar{type}, and \code{S48\_EXTRACT\_VALUE\_POINTER} returns a pointer
 to the contents of the byte vector.
The value returned by \code{S48\_EXTRACT\_VALUE\_POINTER} is valid only until
 the next garbage collection.

\code{S48\_SET\_VALUE} stores \code{value} into the byte vector.

%There are some convenient macros for external objects that hold
% arrays:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \code{S48\_MAKE\_ARRAY($b$, $s$)} returns an external object
%  which holds an array with base type $b$ and size $s$.
%\item \code{S48\_EXTRACT\_ARRAY(\cvar{value}, $b$)} returns the address of the
%  array with base type $b$ inside external object \cvar{value}.  It does not
%  check if \cvar{value} is actually an external object.  Note that the address
%  returned by \code{S48\_EXTRACT\_ARRAY} is only valid until the next
%  \link{heap allocation}[ (see
%  Sec.~\ref{sec:heap-allocation})]{sec:heap-allocation}.
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{C code and heap images}
\label{sec:hibernation}

Scheme~48 uses dumped heap images to restore a previous system state.
The Scheme~48 heap is written into a file in a machine-independent and
 operating-system-independent format.
The procedures described above may be used to create objects in the
 Scheme heap that contain information specific to the current
 machine, operating system, or process.
A heap image containing such objects may not work correctly
 when resumed.

To address this problem, a record type may be given a `resumer'
 procedure.
On startup, the resumer procedure for a type is applied to each record of
 that type in the image being restarted.
This procedure can update the record in a manner appropriate to
 the machine, operating system, or process used to resume the
 image.

\begin{protos}
\protonoresult{define-record-resumer}{ record-type procedure}
\end{protos}

\noindent{}\code{Define-record-resumer} defines \cvar{procedure},
 which should accept one argument, to be the resumer for
 \var{record-type}.
The order in which resumer procedures are called is not specified.

The \cvar{procedure} argument to \code{define-record-resumer} may
 be \code{\#f}, in which case records of the given type are
 not written out in heap images.
When writing a heap image any reference to such a record is replaced by
 the value of the record's first field, and an exception is raised
 after the image is written.

\section{Using Scheme records in C code}

External modules can create records and access their slots
 positionally.

\begin{protos}
\cgcproto{s48\_value s48\_make\_record(s48\_value)}
\cproto{int \ \ \ \ \ \ S48\_RECORD\_P(s48\_value)} 
\cproto{s48\_value S48\_RECORD\_TYPE(s48\_value)} 
\cproto{s48\_value S48\_RECORD\_REF(s48\_value, long)} 
\cproto{void \ \ \ \ \ S48\_RECORD\_SET(s48\_value, long, s48\_value)} 
\end{protos}
%
The argument to \code{s48\_make\_record} should be a shared binding
 whose value is a record type.
In C the fields of Scheme records are only accessible via offsets,
 with the first field having offset zero, the second offset one, and
 so forth.
If the order of the fields is changed in the Scheme definition of the
 record type the C code must be updated as well.

For example, given the following record-type definition
\begin{example}
(define-record-type thing :thing
  (make-thing a b)
  thing?
  (a thing-a)
  (b thing-b))
\end{example}
 the identifier \code{:thing} is bound to the record type and can
 be exported to C:
\begin{example}
(define-exported-binding "thing-record-type" :thing)
\end{example}
\code{Thing} records can then be made in C:
\begin{example}
static s48_value
  thing_record_type_binding = SCHFALSE;

void initialize_things(void)
\{
  S48_GC_PROTECT_GLOBAL(thing_record_type_binding);
  thing_record_type_binding =
     s48_get_imported_binding("thing-record-type");
\}

s48_value make_thing(s48_value a, s48_value b)
\{
  s48_value thing;
  s48_DECLARE_GC_PROTECT(2);

  S48_GC_PROTECT_2(a, b);

  thing = s48_make_record(thing_record_type_binding);
  S48_RECORD_SET(thing, 0, a);
  S48_RECORD_SET(thing, 1, b);

  S48_GC_UNPROTECT();

  return thing;
\}
\end{example}
Note that the variables \code{a} and \code{b} must be protected
 against the possibility of a garbage collection occuring during
 the call to \code{s48\_make\_record()}.

\section{Raising exceptions from external code}
\label{sec:exceptions}

The following macros explicitly raise certain errors, immediately
 returning to Scheme~48.
Raising an exception performs all
 necessary clean-up actions to properly return to Scheme~48, including
 adjusting the stack of protected variables.

\begin{protos}
\cproto{s48\_raise\_scheme\_exception(int type, int nargs, \ldots)}
\end{protos}

\noindent{}\code{s48\_raise\_scheme\_exception} is the base procedure for
 raising exceptions.
\code{type} is the type of exception, and should be one of the
 \code{S48\_EXCEPTION\_}\ldots constants defined in \code{scheme48arch.h}.
\code{nargs} is the number of additional values to be included in the
 exception; these follow the \code{nargs} argument and should all have
 type \code{s48\_value}.
\code{s48\_raise\_scheme\_exception} never returns.
 
The following procedures are available for raising particular
 types of exceptions.
Like \code{s48\_raise\_scheme\_exception} these never return.

\begin{protos}
\cproto{s48\_raise\_argument\_type\_error(s48\_value)}
\cproto{s48\_raise\_argument\_number\_error(int nargs, int min, int max)}
\cproto{s48\_raise\_range\_error(long value, long min, long max)}
\cproto{s48\_raise\_closed\_channel\_error()}
\cproto{s48\_raise\_os\_error(int errno)}
\cproto{s48\_raise\_out\_of\_memory\_error()}
\end{protos}

\noindent{}An argument type error indicates that the given value is of the wrong
 type.
An argument number error is raised when the number of arguments, \code{nargs},
 should be, but isn't, between \code{min} and \code{max}, inclusive.
Similarly, a range error indicates that \code{value} is not between
 between \code{min} and \code{max}, inclusive.

The following macros raise argument type errors if their argument does not
 have the required type.
\code{S48\_CHECK\_BOOLEAN} raises an error if its argument is neither
 \code{\#t} or \code{\#f}.

\begin{protos}
\cproto{void S48\_CHECK\_BOOLEAN(s48\_value)}
\cproto{void S48\_CHECK\_SYMBOL(s48\_value)}
\cproto{void S48\_CHECK\_PAIR(s48\_value)}
\cproto{void S48\_CHECK\_STRING(s48\_value)}
\cproto{void S48\_CHECK\_INTEGER(s48\_value)}
\cproto{void S48\_CHECK\_CHANNEL(s48\_value)}
\cproto{void S48\_CHECK\_BYTE\_VECTOR(s48\_value)}
\cproto{void S48\_CHECK\_RECORD(s48\_value)}
\cproto{void S48\_CHECK\_SHARED\_BINDING(s48\_value)}
\end{protos}

\section{Unsafe functions and macros}

All of the C procedures and macros described above check that their
 arguments have the appropriate types and that indexes are in range.
The following procedures and macros are identical to those described
 above, except that they do not perform type and range checks.

 their general use is not recommended.
