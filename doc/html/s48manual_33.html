<H2>Configuration packages</H2>

<P>It is possible to set up multiple configuration packages.  The default
configuration package opens the following structures:
<UL><LI><TT>module-system</TT>, which exports <TT>define-structure</TT> and the
      other configuration language keywords, as well as standard types
      and type constructors (<TT>:syntax</TT>, <TT>:value</TT>, <TT>proc</TT>, etc.).
<LI><TT>built-in-structures</TT>, which exports structures that are
      built into the initial Scheme&nbsp;48 image; these include
      <TT>scheme</TT>, <TT>threads</TT>, <TT>tables</TT>, and <TT>records</TT>.
<LI><TT>more-structures</TT>, which exports additional structures that
      are available in the development environment. 
      A complete listing
      can be found in the definition of <CODE>more-structures-interface</CODE>
      at the end of the file <CODE>scheme/more-packages.scm</CODE>.
</UL>
Note that it does not open <TT>scheme</TT>.
<P>You can define additional configuration packages by making a package
 that opens <TT>module-system</TT> and, optionally,
 <TT>built-in-structures</TT>,
 <TT>more-structures</TT>, or other structures that
 export structures and interfaces.
<P>For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&gt; ,config (define-structure foo (export)
            (open module-system
                  built-in-structures
                  more-structures))
&gt; ,in foo
foo&gt; (define-structure x (export a b)
       (open scheme)
       (files x))
foo&gt; 
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Unfortunately, the above example does not work.
The problem is that every environment in which
 <CODE>define-structure</CODE> is defined must also have a way to
 create "reflective towers" (a misnomer; a better name would be
 "syntactic towers").
A new reflective tower is required whenever a new environment is created for
 compiling the source code in the package associated with a new structure.
The environment's tower is used at compile time for
 evaluating the <CODE><I>macro-source</I></CODE> in
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
(define-syntax <CODE><I>name</I></CODE> <CODE><I>macro-source</I></CODE>)
(let-syntax ((<CODE><I>name</I></CODE> <CODE><I>macro-source</I></CODE>) <CODE><I>...</I></CODE>) <CODE><I>body</I></CODE>)
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
and so forth.
It is a "tower" because that environment, in turn, has to say what environment
 to use if <CODE>macro-source</CODE> itself contains a use of <CODE>let-syntax</CODE>.
<P>The simplest way to provide a tower maker is to pass on the one used by
 an existing configuration package.
The special form <CODE>export-reflective-tower</CODE> creates an interface
 that exports a configuration package's tower.
The following example uses <CODE>export-reflective-tower</CODE> and
 the <CODE>,structure</CODE> command to obtain a tower maker and create a new
 configuration environment.
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&gt; ,config ,structure t (export-reflective-tower-maker)
&gt; ,config (define-structure foo (export)
            (open module-system
                  t
                  built-in-structures
                  more-structures))
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
