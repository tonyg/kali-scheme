<TITLE>Scheme 48 Manual -- Threads</TITLE>

<EM>Scheme 48 Manual</EM> | <A HREF="s48manual.html#top_node">Contents</A> | In Chapter: <A HREF="s48manual_11.html">Command processor</A><BR>Previous: <A HREF="s48manual_21.html">Resource query and control</A> | Next: <A HREF="s48manual_23.html">Quite obscure</A>
<H2>Threads</H2>
<P>Each command level has its own set of threads.  These threads are suspended
 when a new level is entered and resumed when the owning level again becomes
 the current level.
A thread that raises an error is not resumed unless
 explicitly restarted using the <CODE>,proceed</CODE> command.
In addition to any threads spawned by the user, each level has a thread
 that runs the command processor on that level.
A new command-processor thread is started if the current one
 dies or is terminated.
When a command level is abandoned for a lower level, or when
 a level is restarted using <CODE>,reset</CODE>, all of the threads on that
 level are terminated and any <CODE>dynamic-wind</CODE> "after" thunks are run.
<P>The following commands are useful when debugging multithreaded programs:
<DL><DT><B></B><DD><CODE>,resume [<CODE><I>number</I></CODE>]</CODE><BR>Pops out to a given level and resumes running all threads at that level.
  <CODE><I>Number</I></CODE> defaults to zero.
<DT><B></B><DD><CODE>,threads</CODE><BR>Invokes the inspector on a list of the threads running at the
    next lower command level.
<DT><B></B><DD><CODE>,exit-when-done [<CODE><I>exp</I></CODE>]</CODE><BR>Waits until all user threads have completed and then
    exits back out to shell (or executive or whatever invoked Scheme&nbsp;48
    in the first place).
    <CODE><I>Exp</I></CODE> should evaluate to an integer which is then
    returned to the calling program.
</DL>
<P>
