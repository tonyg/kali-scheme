<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>The module system supports the structured division of a corpus of
Scheme software into a set of modules.  Each module has its own
isolated namespace, with visibility of bindings controlled by module
descriptions written in a special <EM>configuration language.</EM>
<P>A module may be instantiated multiple times, producing several <EM>packages</EM>, just as a lambda-expression can be instantiated multiple
times to produce several different procedures.  Since single
instantiation is the normal case, we will defer discussion of multiple
instantiation until a later section.  For now you can think of a
package as simply a module's internal environment mapping names to
denotations.
<P>A module exports bindings by providing views onto the underlying
package.  Such a view is called a <EM>structure</EM> (terminology from
Standard ML).  One module may provide several different views.  A
structure is just a subset of the package's bindings.  The particular
set of names whose bindings are exported is the structure's <EM>interface</EM>.
<P>A module imports bindings from other modules by either <EM>opening</EM>
or <EM>accessing</EM> some structures that are built on other packages.
When a structure is opened, all of its exported bindings are visible
in the client package.
For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
(define-structure foo (export a c cons)
  (open scheme)
  (begin (define a 1)
         (define (b x) (+ a x))
         (define (c y) (* (b a) y))))

(define-structure bar (export d)
  (open scheme foo)
  (begin (define (d w) (+ a (c w)))))
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
This configuration defines two structures, <TT>foo</TT> and <TT>bar</TT>.
<TT>foo</TT> is a view on a package in which the <TT>scheme</TT> structure's
bindings (including <TT>define</TT> and <TT>+</TT>) are visible, together
with bindings for <TT>a</TT>, <TT>b</TT>,
and <TT>c</TT>.  <TT>foo</TT>'s interface is <TT>(export a c cons)</TT>, so of
the bindings in its underlying package, <TT>foo</TT> only exports those
three.  Similarly, structure <TT>bar</TT> consists of the binding of <TT>d</TT> from a package in which both <TT>scheme</TT>'s and <TT>foo</TT>'s
bindings are visible.  <TT>foo</TT>'s binding of <TT>cons</TT> is imported
from the Scheme structure and then re-exported.
<P>A module's body, the part following <TT>begin</TT> in the above example,
is evaluated in an isolated lexical scope completely specified by the
package definition's <TT>open</TT> and <TT>access</TT> clauses.  In
particular, the binding of the syntactic operator <TT>define-structure</TT>
is not visible unless it comes from some opened structure.  Similarly,
bindings from the <TT>scheme</TT> structure aren't visible unless they
become so by <TT>scheme</TT> (or an equivalent structure) being opened.
<P>
