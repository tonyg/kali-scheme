<H2>Discussion</H2>
<P>This module system was not designed as the be-all and end-all of
Scheme module systems; it was only intended to help us
organize the Scheme&nbsp;48 system.  Not only does the module system
help avoid name clashes by keeping different subsystems in different
namespaces, it has also helped us to tighten up and generalize
Scheme&nbsp;48's internal interfaces.  Scheme&nbsp;48 is unusual among Lisp
implementations in admitting many different possible modes of
operation.  Examples of such multiple modes include the following:
<UL><LI>Linking can be either static or dynamic.
    <LI>The development environment (compiler, debugger, and command
    processor) can run either in the same address space as the program
    being developed or in a different address space.  The environment and
    user program may even run on different processors under different
    operating systems<A HREF="s48manual_77.html#8">[8]</A>.
    <LI>The virtual machine can be supported by either
    of two implementations of its implementation language, Prescheme.
</UL>
The module system has been helpful in organizing these multiple modes.
By forcing us to write down interfaces and module dependencies, the
module system helps us to keep the system clean, or at least to keep
us honest about how clean or not it is.
<P>The need to make structures and interfaces second-class instead of
first-class results from the requirements of static program analysis:
it must be possible for the compiler and linker to expand macros and
resolve variable bindings before the program is executed.  Structures
could be made first-class (as in FX<A HREF="s48manual_77.html#9">[9]</A>) if a
type system were added to Scheme and the definitions of exported
macros were defined in interfaces instead of in module bodies, but
even in that case types and interfaces would remain second-class.
<P>The prohibition on assignment to imported bindings makes substitution
a valid optimization when a module is compiled as a block.  The block
compiler first scans the entire module body, noting which variables
are assigned.  Those that aren't assigned (only <TT>define</TT>d) may be
assumed never assigned, even if they are exported.  The optimizer can
then perform a very simple-minded analysis to determine automatically
that some procedures can and should have their calls compiled in line.
<P>The programming style encouraged by the module system is consistent
with the unextended Scheme language.  Because module system features
do not generally show up within module bodies, an individual module
may be understood by someone who is not familiar with the module
system.  This is a great aid to code presentation and portability.  If
a few simple conditions are met (no name conflicts between packages,
and use of <TT>files</TT> in preference to
<TT>begin</TT>), then a multi-module program can be loaded into a Scheme
implementation that does not support the module system.  The Scheme&nbsp;48
static linker satisfies these conditions, and can therefore run in
other Scheme implementations.  Scheme&nbsp;48's bootstrap process, which is
based on the static linker, is therefore nonincestuous.  This
contrasts with most other integrated programming environments, such as
Smalltalk-80, where the system can only be built using an existing
version of the system itself.
<P>Like ML modules, but unlike Scheme Xerox modules, this module system
is compositional.  That is, structures are constructed by single
syntactic units that compose existing structures with a body of code.
In Scheme Xerox, the set of modules that can contribute to an
interface is open-ended -- any module can contribute bindings to any
interface whose name is in scope.  The module system implementation is
a cross-bar that channels definitions from modules to interfaces.  The
module system described here has simpler semantics and makes
dependencies easier to trace.  It also allows for higher-order
modules, which Scheme Xerox considers unimportant.
